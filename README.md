# README
This github account (greenwoode) is not a complete portfolio

Some of my projects are under [greenwoode1atwit](https://github.com/greenwoode1atwit), while others are on group-member's accounts and/or privated. If you are looking for examples of a specific skill/library/technology, please reach out to me at Ethan.A.Greenwood@gmail.com so I can provide it.

It is also of note that after the conclusion of [my thesis](https://github.com/greenwoode/Deep-Learning-Specialization), I moved to a personal git server which mainly houses projects I deemed too simple to justify uploading here, or are the couple of projects I am pursuing which hold monetary potential and will remain off a remote server. Feel free to email me if you wish to learn more about these, but I ask for your understanding in why they are not here.
